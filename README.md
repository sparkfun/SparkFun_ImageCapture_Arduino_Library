# SparkFun_ImageCapture_Arduino_Library
Arduino library for image sensors

This is a fork of [this Arduino library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ImageCapture) that adds simple support for the OV5640 based on [this Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_OV5640). This is only intended as a quick hack to add basic OV5640 support, so features are limited and long-term support is not guaranteed.
